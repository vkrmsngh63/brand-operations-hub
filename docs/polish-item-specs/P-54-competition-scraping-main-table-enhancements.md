# `/competition-scraping` main-table enhancements — full spec

**Polish-item ID:** P-54 (next free ID after P-53; main `/competition-scraping` page / `UrlTable` enhancements)
**Created:** 2026-06-01 (`session_2026-06-01-b` — requirements-gathering opener)
**Status:** §1 captured VERBATIM. §2/§3 = requirements-gathering IN PROGRESS this session (Q&A + output-shape planning BEFORE any code, per `feedback_plan_output_shape_before_building`). No code yet.

**Context note:** Opened when the director DEFERRED (a.119) `/comprehensive-analysis` AI-summary (P-51) to "the session after the requirements of the features mentioned today are finished," and instead directed this batch of `/competition-scraping` main-page changes.

## §1 — Original director instructions (VERBATIM, append-only)

**2026-06-01 — director's directive (verbatim):**

> I want to add the following things to Workflow #2:
>
> '/competition-scraping' page changes:
>
> - In the '/competition-scraping' page, the right edge of the table (which is also the right border of the last column) is not draggable. That means the user cannot adjust the width of the last column. Please fix this so that the user can adjust the width of the last column.
>
> - The horizontal scroll at the bottom of the table should be floating at the bottom of the user's screen so that no matter where the user is along the vertical length of the table, they can scroll horizontally.
>
> - Currently, on the '/competition-scraping' page, between the 'Resouces' box and the 'Platforms' box, there is a blue button with the text 'Comprehensive Competitor Analysis'. Please remove this button because we already have a link at the top (Comprehensive Analysis) that goes to the same page.
>
> - Please don't make the table scrolls separate from the page scrolls. If the user wants to scroll vertically or horizontally to see the table, they should be able to use the page scrolls.
>
> - The user should be able to move columns relative to each other and position them in different relative orders. Once a user does that, the system should remember this server side.
>
> - Besides the 'Platforms' and 'Columns' boxes that have options of sorting views in the table, there should be another box called 'Sort By' and there should be 3 options:
>   -- 'Platform': Which should group all rows by common platforms.
>   -- 'Category': Which should group all rows by common categories.
>   -- 'Type': Which should group all rows by common types.
>
> - When the user adds any text using the Workflow #2 extension to a competitor url, the system should create a new column to the left of the 'Added On' column on the table with the header text that has the format 'Content Category: [Acme]' where '[Acme]' is replaced with the content category name chosen by the user and then in the cell in that column and the row of that competitor url, the system should add the text that the user added under that url. When a new column is added in such a way, the system should also add a sorting checkbox in the 'Columns' box with the text 'Content Categories' so that when this checkbox is checked, all the individual content categories columns will be shown and when the checkbox is unchecked all the content category columns will be hidden. Note that to the immediate right of each content category column, the system should create another column that has the text format '[Content Category Name] Analysis' where '[Content Category Name]' is replaced with the content category name of the column to the immediate left and in this column that system should add the data from the 'Your Analysis' box under that specific text from the competitor's details page which was added to the cell to its immediate left. Make sure the data from the 'Your Analysis' box is always added to the correct column and row in the table - which means, the your analysis should always be in the cell to the immediate right of the text associated with it, in the row of that specific competitor. Also, note that the 'Content Category: [Acme]' column and its associated '[Content Category Name] Analysis' column should be "locked together" in the table. In other words, if the user decides to move either the 'Content Category: [Acme]' column or its associated '[Content Category Name] Analysis' column within the table to a different location relative to other columns, both the columns should move together.
>
> - When the user adds any image using the Workflow #2 extension to a competitor url, the system should create a new column to the left of the 'Added On' column on the table with the header text that has the format 'Image Category Embedded Text: [Acme]' where '[Acme]' is replaced with the image category name chosen by the user and then in the cell in that column and the row of that competitor url, the system should add the embedded text that the user added under that url. Note that if the user updates the embedded text in the competitor's details page, this data should get updated in the table in real-time as well. When a new column is added in such a way, the system should also add a sorting checkbox in the 'Columns' box with the text 'Image Categories' so that when this checkbox is checked, all the individual image categories columns will be shown and when the checkbox is unchecked all the image category columns will be hidden. Note that to the immediate right of each image category column, the system should create another column that has the text format '[Image Category Name] Analysis' where '[Image Category Name]' is replaced with the image category name of the column to the immediate left and in this column that system should add the data from the 'Your Analysis' box under that specific image embedded text from the competitor's details page which was added to the cell to its immediate left. Make sure the data from the 'Your Analysis' box is always added to the correct column and row in the table - which means, the your analysis should always be in the cell to the immediate right of the embedded text associated with it, in the row of that specific competitor. Also, note that the 'Image Category Embedded Text: [Acme]' column and its associated '[Image Category Name] Analysis' column should be "locked together" in the table. In other words, if the user decides to move either the 'Image Category Embedded Text: [Acme]' column or its associated '[Image Category Name] Analysis' column within the table to a different location relative to other columns, both the columns should move together.
>
> - When the user adds any video using the Workflow #2 extension to a competitor url, the system should create a new column to the left of the 'Added On' column on the table with the header text that has the format 'Vieo Category Embedded Text: [Acme]' where '[Acme]' is replaced with the video category name chosen by the user and then in the cell in that column and the row of that competitor url, the system should add the embedded text that the user added under that url. Note that if the user updates the embedded text in the competitor's details page, this data should get updated in the table in real-time as well. When a new column is added in such a way, the system should also add a sorting checkbox in the 'Columns' box with the text 'Video Categories' so that when this checkbox is checked, all the individual video categories columns will be shown and when the checkbox is unchecked all the video category columns will be hidden. Note that to the immediate right of each video category column, the system should create another column that has the text format '[Video Category Name] Analysis' where '[Video Category Name]' is replaced with the video category name of the column to the immediate left and in this column that system should add the data from the 'Your Analysis' box under that specific video embedded text from the competitor's details page which was added to the cell to its immediate left. Make sure the data from the 'Your Analysis' box is always added to the correct column and row in the table - which means, the your analysis should always be in the cell to the immediate right of the embedded text associated with it, in the row of that specific competitor. Also, note that the 'Video Category Embedded Text: [Acme]' column and its associated '[Video Category Name] Analysis' column should be "locked together" in the table. In other words, if the user decides to move either the 'Video Category Embedded Text: [Acme]' column or its associated '[Video Category Name] Analysis' column within the table to a different location relative to other columns, both the columns should move together.

## §2 — Code-truth findings (Rule 3 audit, 2026-06-01)

Captured at session start to ground the joint-discussion. File:line citations from the two Explore passes.

**Main table component:** `src/app/projects/[projectId]/competition-scraping/components/UrlTable.tsx`. Current 18 columns in order: `platform`(Platform), `competitionCategory`(Category), `type`(Type), `isSponsoredAd`(Sponsored), `productName`(Product Name), `brandName`(Brand Name), `description1`, `description2`, `resultsPageRank`, `price`, `productStarRating`, `numProductReviews`, `sellerStarRating`, `numSellerReviews`, `competitionScore`, `url`(URL), `scrapingStatus`(Status), **`addedAt`(Added On) = LAST column**. Column defs live in `components/url-table-columns.ts` (`TABLE_COLUMN_DEFS`).

- **R1:** A `ColumnResizeHandle` is rendered at `right:0` of EVERY `<th>`, *including* the last (`addedAt`) per the agent. Yet director reports the last column's right edge is not draggable → REAL BUG to diagnose (likely the handle at the table's far right edge is clipped/occluded by the `overflow:auto` container boundary, or the table `width:max-content` leaves the handle outside the scroll viewport). Do NOT assume already-fixed; diagnose live.
- **R2 + R4 TENSION:** Table is currently wrapped in a single `<div style={{ overflow:'auto', maxHeight:'calc(100vh - 200px)', minHeight:'400px', position:'relative' }}>` — BOTH horizontal and vertical scroll happen INSIDE this inner container (separate from the page/window scroll). `<thead>` is `position:sticky`. R4 wants the page/window to own the scroll (drop the inner vertical container); R2 wants a horizontal scrollbar pinned (floating) to the viewport bottom. These must be reconciled — see §4 Q-A.
- **R3:** Blue button = `CompetitionScrapingViewer.tsx` ~lines 505-529, `data-testid="open-comprehensive-analysis-button"`, positioned above the `ColumnVisibilityBar`. Duplicate of the `CompetitionScrapingSurfaceNav` "Comprehensive Analysis" tab (`CompetitionScrapingSurfaceNav.tsx` ~lines 65-70). (Director's "Resouces"/"Resources box" reference — confirm exact layout neighbor; the agent located it above the Platforms/Columns bar.)
- **R5:** Column REORDER does NOT exist today (order fixed by `TABLE_COLUMN_DEFS`). Only column RESIZE + column SHOW/HIDE + ROW reorder exist. Persistence model = `UserTablePreferences` (per user × per project) with `columnVisibility`, `columnWidths`, `fontSize`, `rowOrder` Json fields + `lastUsedSortColumn/Direction`. A NEW `columnOrder` Json field (additive nullable) would be the natural home → schema-change-in-flight.
- **R6:** No row-GROUPING on the main page today (only per-column click-sort). The sibling pages `/reviews-analysis-by-category` + `/reviews-analysis-by-type` already implement banner-row grouping by category/type (helpers `category-table-grouping.ts` / `type-table-grouping.ts`); "Platform" grouping would be net-new.
- **Control boxes:** `components/ColumnVisibilityBar.tsx` renders the Platforms group (multi-select platform checkboxes) + the Columns group (data-driven from `TABLE_COLUMN_DEFS`). A new "Sort By" box would slot here.
- **R7/R8/R9 data model:** One main-table row = one `CompetitorUrl`. A URL can have MANY `CapturedText` / `CapturedImage` / `CapturedVideo` items, and MULTIPLE in the SAME category. Category names are free-text strings on the items (`CapturedText.contentCategory`, `CapturedImage.imageCategory`, `CapturedVideo.videoCategory`), each referencing a per-Project `VocabularyEntry` (`vocabularyType` = content-/image-/video-category). "Your Analysis" per item = `analysis` (TipTap JSON) on each captured row. Image/Video "embedded text" = `embeddedText` (nullable Text, editable on detail page via PATCH `/images/[imageId]` + `/videos/[videoId]`). **Crux:** mapping "the text/embedded-text the user added" + "its Your Analysis" into ONE table cell when a URL has multiple items per category needs a defined rule (stack-as-sub-rows like the reviews rowSpan pattern? newest only? concatenate?) — see §4 Q-D.

---

## §3 — Current consolidated spec (rolled-up source-of-truth)

**APPROVED via two AskUserQuestion rounds with director, 2026-06-01-b.** Phase plan APPROVED ("plan all now, build & deploy phase-by-phase across multiple sessions, real-Chrome check after each deploy").

### Resolved design decisions

- **D1 (scroll model — R2+R4):** Page/window owns VERTICAL scroll — REMOVE the inner `maxHeight:calc(100vh-200px)` vertical scroll container so the table scrolls with the page. HORIZONTAL navigation = a floating horizontal scrollbar pinned (position:fixed) to the bottom of the viewport, reachable at any vertical position, driving the table's horizontal offset. (Sticky header on page-scroll = design detail, default keep header sticky to viewport top.)
- **D2 (Sort By grouping — R6):** Banner-row grouping, REUSING the `/reviews-analysis-by-category` + `/reviews-analysis-by-type` pattern (group header row + nested competitor rows + an `(Untyped)`/`(Uncategorized)` bucket). Three groupings: Platform / Category (`competitionCategory`) / Type (`type`). Mutually exclusive selection; a "None"/flat default must remain (confirm flat = current ungrouped view). Note: Sort-By "Category"/"Type" = the COMPETITOR's `competitionCategory`/`type` columns — distinct from the captured-content categories of R7/R8/R9.
- **D3 (multi-item cells — R7/R8/R9):** Stacked, aligned sub-rows — each captured item stacks vertically in the category cell; its "Your Analysis" sits exactly beside it in the immediate-right column. REUSE the reviews-table `rowSpan` sub-row alignment pattern.
- **D4 (freshness — R7/R8/R9 "real-time"):** Refetch-on-return (re-fetch latest data when the table is opened or its tab/window regains focus — the `visibilitychange`/`focus` pattern already shipped on the review pages). NOT true websocket live-sync (director confirmed live infra not needed).
- **D5 (cell editing — R7/R8/R9):** **DIRECTOR OVERRODE the read-only recommendation → cells are EDITABLE in the table too.** The dynamic category cells (captured text body / image+video `embeddedText` / per-item `analysis` "Your Analysis") edit IN the table and write back to the SAME CapturedText/Image/Video records via the existing PATCH routes (`/text/[textId]`, `/images/[imageId]`, `/videos/[videoId]`). DESIGN CHALLENGE (Phase 5): "Your Analysis" is TipTap rich text — needs a clean in-cell rich-text editing approach (e.g. expand-on-click / popover editor) rather than a raw inline contenteditable in a narrow cell.
- **D6 (persistence scope — R5):** **DIRECTOR OVERRODE the per-user recommendation → column ORDER + show/hide are SHARED across the Project** (everyone sees the same layout). Requires a NEW project-scoped store (today `UserTablePreferences` is per-user×per-project). **OPEN boundary to confirm before Phase 3:** do column WIDTHS + ROW order + fontSize also become Project-shared, or stay per-user? (Default assumption pending confirmation: column order + ALL column visibility/show-hide → Project-shared; column widths + row order + fontSize → remain per-user.)
- **D7 (default visibility — R7/R8/R9):** Category columns SHOWN by default when their content exists; the new group checkboxes ("Content Categories" / "Image Categories" / "Video Categories") in the Columns box hide/show them.
- **D8 (locked pairs — R7/R8/R9):** Each `… Category …` column + its immediate-right `… Analysis` column move together as a locked pair under column reorder (R5).
- **D9 (cells editable, R7 text column content):** the text-category column cell mirrors+edits the captured text body; image/video category column cells mirror+edit `embeddedText`.

### Approved phase split (build phase-by-phase, deploy + real-Chrome verify each)

- **Phase 1 (quick wins):** R3 (remove the blue button) + R1 (fix last-column right-edge resize bug). No schema change.
- **Phase 2 (scroll model):** R2 + R4 per D1.
- **Phase 3 (column reorder + shared persistence):** R5 per D6 (new project-scoped store + drag-to-reorder columns). Schema-change-in-flight likely YES. Confirm D6 boundary first.
- **Phase 4 (Sort By grouping):** R6 per D2.
- **Phase 5 (dynamic category columns):** R7 → R8 → R9 per D3/D4/D5/D7/D8/D9 (the large feature; locked pairs interplay with Phase 3 reorder + Phase 4 grouping). May need schema for storing the shared column order of dynamic pairs keyed by category name.

## §4 — Open questions

**RESOLVED 2026-06-01-b:** Q-A → D1. Q-C → D2. Q-D → D3. Q-E persistence → D6 (shared). Q-G → approved phase split. (Q-B last-column = `addedAt` confirmed implicitly; diagnose-and-fix in Phase 1.)

**STILL OPEN (do not block Phase 1/2; resolve before the named phase):**
- **Q-E2 (before Phase 3):** D6 boundary — do column WIDTHS + ROW order + fontSize also become Project-shared, or stay per-user? (Default pending: column order + visibility shared; widths + row order + fontSize per-user.)
- **Q-F (before Phase 5):** dynamic column-pair identity in the shared store — keyed by category-name string. Behavior when a new category first appears (append at default position left of `addedAt`, natural order) vs when a category is deleted (drop from saved order). Confirm default.
- **Q-H (before Phase 4):** confirm the "Sort By" box has a "None"/flat default = the current ungrouped table; and how grouping coexists with column reorder + the existing per-column click-sort + row drag-reorder.
- **Q-I (before Phase 5):** in-cell rich-text editing UX for the "Your Analysis" column (D5) — expand/popover editor vs inline.
