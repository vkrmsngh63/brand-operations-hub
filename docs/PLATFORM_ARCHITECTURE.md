# PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE
## Technical architecture of the Product Launch Operating System (PLOS)

**Last updated:** May 4, 2026-d (Pool-tune small-batch test — INSUFFICIENT — fourth session of 2026-05-04. **§10 "Connection pool exhaustion" entry updated with burst-size correction:** the actual parallel-PATCH burst is **55-60+ per batch, NOT the 22 estimated 2026-05-04-c.** Vercel log expansion in tonight's session counted ~40 successful + ~18 failed PATCHes in a 3-second window during Bursitis Test 2 batch 2 (19 operations applied). Earlier estimate was based on a Vercel view showing only failures. Pool tune from default 15 → 40 was tried tonight (67% of Nano compute's max_connections=60 cap; comfortably below Supabase's 80% warning threshold) and was INSUFFICIENT — same FATAL: Max client connections reached recurred. Pool tune at Nano compute is structurally insufficient; the apply-pipeline parallel-PATCH-burst reduction code-fix is now PRIMARY and gate-blocking. **Phase 3 implication tightened:** 50 workers × 60 burst = 3000 simultaneous connections at peak — uncoverable by any compute tier upgrade Supabase offers (largest 16XL caps at ~12,000 max client connections but per-pool default is still small). Code-fix (worker queue / bulk endpoint / atomic-batch-into-rebuild-transaction) is the only structural answer. **NEW MEDIUM finding:** P2025 race condition between canvas-rebuild $transaction's archive operation and parallel keyword PATCHes — captured as separate ROADMAP entry. Header timestamp.)

**Previously updated:** May 4, 2026-c (D3 retry attempt — partial; pool-exhaustion finding ON PRO TIER — third session of 2026-05-04, follow-up to `session_2026-05-04-b_rate-fix-first-pass`. **§10 gains "🚨 Connection pool exhaustion under apply-pipeline burst (DISCOVERED 2026-05-04-c)"** entry capturing the discovered failure mode: ~22 parallel PATCH /keywords/[id] calls per batch — burst size corrected 2026-05-04-d to 55-60+. Different failure mode than the 2026-05-04-b rate-fix targets (no Prisma error code; just FATAL message). **CORRECTION post-original-commit:** director clarified Pro upgrade was already done at end of 2026-05-04-b; tonight's failure was on Pro tier, not Free. Revised fix path was: tune Pro pool-size config knob (probable primary fix), AND/OR ship apply-pipeline parallel-PATCH-burst reduction code-fix. Pool tuning was tried 2026-05-04-d and was INSUFFICIENT — code-fix is now confirmed primary.)

**Previously updated:** May 4, 2026-b (Rate-fix first pass — second session of 2026-05-04, follow-up to instrumentation pass. **§10 gains "🛡️ Server-side withRetry parity — first-pass closed (SHIPPED 2026-05-04-b)"** entry capturing the rate-layer fix: `lib/auth.ts` (`verifyProjectAuth` + `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth`) + `lib/workflow-status.ts` (`markWorkflowActive` + `ensureProjectWorkflow`) helpers wrapped in `withRetry()` (universal silent-multiplier finding from 2026-05-04 audit) + apply-pipeline writes (POST `/canvas/rebuild` $transaction; POST/PATCH/DELETE `/canvas/nodes`; PATCH `/canvas`; `/canvas/sister-links` + `/canvas/pathways` creates/deletes; keywords routes; removed-keywords + restore) all wrapped. Combined coverage ~4% → ~80%+ of authenticated apply-pipeline paths. Idempotency tradeoff for unique-constraint-free creates documented. Header timestamp.)
**Previously updated:** May 4, 2026 (Underlying flake-rate investigation — first investigation session of W#1 PRODUCTION-READINESS GATE prerequisite #3. §10 gains "📊 Platform-wide flake-rate telemetry (SHIPPED 2026-05-04)" entry: new pure helper `src/lib/flake-counter.ts` (~140 LOC) + 28 unit tests; all 19 DB-backed API routes wired (38 catch blocks ↔ 38 `recordFlake(...)` call sites — exact 1-to-1; additive only); 2 wrapped routes record with `retried: true`; `/canvas/rebuild` POST captures `body.nodes.length` as canvasSize. Investigation findings preserved as platform-level facts: pgbouncer hypothesis grounded (transaction pooler at port 6543); withRetry parity ~4% at endpoint layer; silent multiplier in `lib/auth.ts` + `lib/workflow-status.ts` helpers; Prisma client uses bare singleton with no connection-lifecycle management. Helper is workflow-agnostic — every future DB-backed route across all 14 PLOS workflows uses the same telemetry surface. Cross-references to ROADMAP entry + KEYWORD_CLUSTERING_ACTIVE STATE block + existing `prisma-retry.ts`.)

New `scripts/backfill-intent-fingerprints.ts` ran live (~$0.20). 22 new src/lib tests → 210 passing; build clean. §10 entry added.)

**Purpose:** Defines the technical structure of the platform — routes, database schema, authentication, shared systems, file organization. Loaded in every chat as part of Group A.

**Note on scale context (added 2026-04-17):** The scale and user-model assumptions this doc is evaluated against are defined in `PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md` (Group A). Summary for quick reference: Phase 1 = admin-solo at ~50 Projects/week; Phase 3 = ~50 concurrent workers, 500 Projects/week; Phase 4 = 5,000 Projects/week headroom. Architecture must target Phase 3 as minimum; Phase 4 as stretch. Where Phase 3/4 scale is not yet addressed in current code, gaps are tracked in §10 Known Technical Debt.

### Development environment
- **Codespace:** `/workspaces/brand-operations-hub`
- **Repo:** GitHub `brand-operations-hub` (name kept despite rebrand to PLOS)
- **Deploy flow:** Push to GitHub `main` → Vercel auto-deploys → live at vklf.com
- **Known Codespaces issue:** PORTS tab often doesn't show port 3000. Do NOT troubleshoot. Push to GitHub → Vercel deploy → test at vklf.com with Ctrl+Shift+R.

## 3. Routes (URL → behavior)

### Current routes (as of end of Phase M Checkpoint 8)

| URL | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | No | Login |
| `/dashboard` | Yes | Initial Landing Page — 3 system cards (PLOS/PMS/Think Tank). 📝 Notes button in top-right (Ckpt 8) → `/dashboard/notes`. |
| `/dashboard/notes` | Yes | **NEW (Ckpt 8)** — Dashboard Admin Notes. Thin 11-line wrapper passing `system="dashboard"` to shared `AdminNotes` component. |
| `/plos` | Yes | PLOS Landing — 14 workflow cards + Business Ops. 📝 Notes button in top-right (Ckpt 8) → `/plos/notes`. Keyword Analysis card routes to `/projects` (Ckpt 8 rewire — previously pointed at deleted `/keyword-clustering`). |
| `/plos/notes` | Yes | **NEW (Ckpt 8)** — PLOS Admin Notes. Thin 11-line wrapper passing `system="plos"` to shared `AdminNotes` component. |
| `/pms` | Yes | PMS placeholder + Admin Notes button |
| `/pms/notes` | Yes | PMS Admin Notes |
| `/think-tank` | Yes | Think Tank landing (projects in localStorage) |
| `/think-tank/notes` | Yes | Think Tank Admin Notes |
| `/projects` | Yes | **(Ckpt 6)** — Projects list page with search/filter/sort/infinite-scroll/create/edit/delete. Also serves as PLOS Projects View. |
| `/projects/[projectId]` | Yes | **(Built for real in Ckpt 9.5)** — Project detail page showing Project name + description + 15-card workflow grid (14 launch workflows + Business Operations) with per-workflow status badges. Clicking Keyword Analysis card → `/projects/[id]/keyword-clustering`. Other cards show "coming soon" toast. Handles 404/403/loading gracefully. **Note:** Ckpt 6 docs originally claimed this was built in Ckpt 6, but the file never existed on disk until Ckpt 9.5 — see CORRECTIONS_LOG for the Pattern 7 recurrence details. |
| `/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering` | Yes | **(Ckpt 7)** — Keyword Clustering workspace, single-state (Project pre-picked from URL). Reads projectId from URL, fetches Project name, renders `<KeywordWorkspace>`. |

### Deleted routes (previously existed)

| URL | Deleted in | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `/keyword-clustering` | Ckpt 7 | Replaced by `/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering`. The old dual-state page (Projects List + Workspace) is no longer needed — Projects List lives on `/projects`; workspace lives under the per-Project URL. |
| `/projects/projectId` (no brackets) | Ckpt 7 | Stray folder leftover from Ckpt 6 draft-save-gone-wrong; never a real route; was creating a useless `/projects/projectId` entry in the build output. Cleaned up during Ckpt 7. |

### Planned routes (Phase M Checkpoint 9 — no new routes; Ckpt 9 is deploy + cleanup only)

| URL | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/projects/[projectId]/<future-workflow>` | Yes | Each future workflow (workflows 2–14) will have a route under `/projects/[projectId]/` |

### API routes (all require JWT via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

**Post-Ckpt-5 — aligned with new schema; unchanged by Ckpt 6 or 7:**
| Route | Method | Purpose | Auth helper |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/projects` | GET / POST | List user's Projects (sorted by aggregate lastActivityAt) / Create | `verifyAuth` |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]` | GET / PATCH / DELETE | Read (slim — Project + workflow statuses) / update name+description / delete cascade | `verifyProjectAuth` |
| `/api/project-workflows/[projectId]` | GET | List all ProjectWorkflow rows for a Project (for Projects page status badges) | `verifyProjectAuth` |
| `/api/project-workflows/[projectId]/[workflow]` | GET / PATCH | Read / update single workspace status (auto-creates row on first peek, manual active/completed toggle) | `verifyProjectAuth` + ensureProjectWorkflow |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]/keywords` | GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE | Keywords CRUD — uses projectWorkflowId internally | `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth("keyword-clustering")` |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]/keywords/[keywordId]` | PATCH / DELETE | Single keyword update/delete | `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth("keyword-clustering")` |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]/removed-keywords` | GET / POST | List soft-archived keywords / soft-archive (transactional copy-then-delete; body accepts `removedSource` + `aiReasoning`) | `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth("keyword-clustering")` |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]/removed-keywords/[removedId]/restore` | POST | Reverse soft-archive (transactional re-create as Keyword + delete RemovedKeyword); 409 on text-collision | `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth("keyword-clustering")` |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]/canvas` | GET / PATCH | Full canvas read / canvas state (viewport/counters) update | `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth("keyword-clustering")` |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]/canvas/nodes` | GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE | Node CRUD (bulk PATCH transactional) | `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth("keyword-clustering")` |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]/canvas/pathways` | POST / DELETE | Pathway create/delete | `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth("keyword-clustering")` |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]/canvas/sister-links` | POST / DELETE | Sister link create/delete | `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth("keyword-clustering")` |
| `/api/projects/[projectId]/canvas/rebuild` | POST | Atomic diff-based canvas rebuild | `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth("keyword-clustering")` |
| `/api/ai/analyze` | POST | Auto-Analyze AI endpoint (unchanged in Ckpt 5) | — |
| `/api/admin-notes?system=` | GET | List admin notes for a system | `verifyAuth` |
| `/api/admin-notes` | POST | Create admin note | `verifyAuth` |
| `/api/admin-notes/[noteId]` | GET / PATCH / DELETE | Note CRUD | `verifyAuth` |
| `/api/admin-notes/reorder` | POST | Bulk reorder (transactional) | `verifyAuth` |
| `/api/admin-notes/[noteId]/attachments` | POST | Upload attachment (multipart) | `verifyAuth` |
| `/api/admin-notes/[noteId]/attachments/[attachmentId]` | DELETE | Delete attachment | `verifyAuth` |
| `/api/user-preferences/[key]` | GET / PUT | Per-user preference upsert | `verifyAuth` |

**Activity tracking side-effect (post-Ckpt-5):** All KC workflow-data routes (keywords, canvas nodes, pathways, sister-links, rebuild) call `markWorkflowActive(projectId, "keyword-clustering")` after successful mutations. This flips `ProjectWorkflow.status` from `"inactive"` to `"active"` on first meaningful use and refreshes `lastActivityAt`. GET endpoints and canvas state (pan/zoom) do NOT trigger activity tracking.

---

## 4. `/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering` page — current live state (Ckpt 7)

Following Ckpt 7, the Keyword Clustering client page is now a **single-state, URL-driven page**. Key properties:

- **Route:** `/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering` (Next.js App Router; `[projectId]` is a dynamic segment)
- **File:** `src/app/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering/page.tsx` (164 lines)
- **Reads projectId from URL** via `useParams()`, not from component state
- **Fetches Project summary** on mount via `GET /api/projects/[projectId]` to populate the header with the Project name
- **Handles 404/403** with friendly error UI + "Back to Projects" button (rather than crashing or silently failing)
- **Back-to-Project navigation** via the top-bar link → `/projects/[projectId]` (the Project detail page)
- **Preserves all existing workspace code** — the `<KeywordWorkspace>` component and its tree under `components/` moved alongside the page unchanged, still receive `projectId, userId, aiMode` as props
- **Build-compatible** — `npm run build` completes without errors; new route appears in the build output as `ƒ /projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering`

### What Ckpt 7 removed from the old page
- "Projects List" state (State A of the old dual-state page) — the project list, "+ New Project" form, and delete buttons
- `activeProjectId` state variable and its associated setter logic
- `fetchProjects()` function (listing was on the old page; now on `/projects`)
- `createProject()` function (now on `/projects` via the "+ New Project" inline form)
- `deleteProject()` function (now on `/projects` via the two-step delete confirm)
- The "← Back to projects" sub-topbar link that used to sit below the main topbar in State B — no longer needed, the main "Back to Project" is the single Back control

### What Ckpt 7 did NOT change
- `KeywordWorkspace.tsx` and every file under `components/` — same code, moved to new location, still referenced by relative imports (`./components/KeywordWorkspace`). Git detected all 44 files as renames (100% content match).
- The API routes — `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth` already creates the ProjectWorkflow row on first access, so the workspace works regardless of whether this is the Project's first visit to Keyword Clustering or the 100th.
- The Auto-Analyze checkpoint key pattern — already uses `projectWorkflowId`, not `projectId`, so no change needed.

### Deploy status
**The app remains in a Phase-M-hold deploy state until Ckpt 9.** Everything Ckpts 1–7 have built exists only in local commits (`3b69cf2` Ckpt 6, `5cc10c5` Ckpt 7). The live site at vklf.com still runs the pre-Phase-M commit (`f545e2a`) which is fully broken against the new Supabase schema. Safety branch `phase-m-safety-net` at `f545e2a` remains available for emergency rollback.

## 5. Database schema

Source of truth: `prisma/schema.prisma`

### 5.1 Terminology alignment (IMPORTANT)

- **"Project"** — user-facing concept AND database table name. One Project = one product launch effort.
- **"ProjectWorkflow"** — internal database table (user never sees this term). Tracks per-workflow state for a Project. Holds the data bucket for each workflow.
- **All workflow data tables** (Keyword, CanvasNode, Pathway, SisterLink, CanvasState) reference `projectWorkflowId`.

### 5.2 LIVE schema (as of end of Phase M Checkpoint 5; unchanged by Ckpts 6–7)

This is the schema currently running in Supabase. The server-side code aligns with it (Ckpt 5 done); client-side UI alignment completed in Ckpts 6–7.

```prisma

// aiReasoning (nullable Text — model rationale for auto removals).
// @@index([projectWorkflowId]). FK has onDelete: Cascade.
```

For the complete file, see `prisma/schema.prisma` (~240 lines as of Session 3a).

### 5.3 Schema evolution philosophy

Per `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` §13, the schema evolves iteratively as new needs are discovered during workflow builds. Future schema changes will:

- Add optional fields with defaults (safe migrations)
- Create new tables for new workflows when those workflows are built
- Document every new field in `DATA_CATALOG.md` in the same chat the field is added

When rename-level or type-change migrations become necessary (rare), they're flagged as risky and handled carefully with explicit user approval.

### 5.4 What Phase M has completed vs. what remains

**Completed (Checkpoints 1–8):**
- ✅ Backup of pre-Phase M schema (`prisma/schema.prisma.bak`)
- ✅ Git safety branch (`phase-m-safety-net` at commit `f545e2a`)
- ✅ New schema written and validated
- ✅ Database reset via `npx prisma db push --force-reset` (all pre-Phase M data wiped, confirmed OK by user)
- ✅ New tables verified in Supabase Table Editor
- ✅ **Ckpt 5:** All server-side API routes aligned with new schema; `npm run build` clean; committed at `14d68e7`
- ✅ **Ckpt 6 (2026-04-17, chat `7a745b12-...`):** Built `/projects` page (~1,493 lines) and `/projects/[projectId]` detail page (~372 lines) with scale-aware features; committed at `3b69cf2`.
- ✅ **Ckpt 7 (2026-04-17, chat `7e0b8456-...`):** Refactored Keyword Clustering to `/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering`, deleted old `/keyword-clustering` folder, cleaned up stray `projects/projectId` folder; `npm run build` clean; committed at `5cc10c5`.
- ✅ **Ckpt 8 (2026-04-17, chat `fc8025bf-...`):** Admin Notes added to `/dashboard` and `/plos`; `/plos` Keyword Analysis card rewired to `/projects`. Files changed: 3 edits (AdminNotes.tsx type extension, dashboard/page.tsx button, plos/page.tsx button + route rewire) + 2 new files (dashboard/notes/page.tsx, plos/notes/page.tsx). `npm run build` clean in 18.5s (17/17 static pages). Committed at `ac62a3a`.

**Remaining (Checkpoint 9):**
- Checkpoint 9: Deploy to vklf.com. Cleanup of 13 pre-existing leftover files in working tree + ~32 committed `.bak` files. `src/app/HANDOFF.md` / `src/app/ROADMAP.md` relocation. Add `*.bak*` to `.gitignore`. `npm run build`, commit, push, deploy, verify on vklf.com, visual-test all Phase M pages.

## 6. Authentication system

### How it works
- Supabase Auth issues JWTs on login
- Client stores session in Supabase client (persists via localStorage under Supabase's keys)
- Client-side code uses `authFetch()` from `src/lib/authFetch.ts` to add `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`
- Server-side API routes call `verifyAuth()`, `verifyProjectAuth()`, or `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth()` from `src/lib/auth.ts`

### `verifyAuth(req)` → `{ userId, error }`
Validates JWT. Returns `userId` on success, 401 on failure.

### `verifyProjectAuth(req, projectId)` → `{ userId, projectId, error }`
Validates JWT AND checks user owns the Project. Returns 403 on ownership mismatch, 404 if Project missing.

### `verifyProjectWorkflowAuth(req, projectId, workflow)` → `{ userId, projectId, projectWorkflowId, workflow, error }` (NEW in Ckpt 5)
Does everything `verifyProjectAuth` does, PLUS upserts the `ProjectWorkflow` row for `(projectId, workflow)` so the caller always gets a valid `projectWorkflowId` to use. If the row doesn't exist yet, it's created with `status = "inactive"` — the first meaningful mutation will bump it to `"active"` via `markWorkflowActive`.

### History
- Originally trusted `x-user-id` header — security hole
- Phase 1-foundation added real JWT verification on ALL API routes
- Phase M Ckpt 5 added workflow-scoped auth helper

---

## 7. Shared systems

### AdminNotes (shared component)
- Location: `src/components/AdminNotes.tsx`
- Used by: `/pms/notes`, `/think-tank/notes`, `/dashboard/notes` (Ckpt 8), `/plos/notes` (Ckpt 8)
- Parameterized by `system` prop — separate data per system
- `SystemKey` type (line 34): `"think-tank" | "pms" | "dashboard" | "plos"` (last two added in Ckpt 8)
- Features: rich text editor, fonts, bold/italic/underline/color/alignment/lists/hyperlinks, undo/redo, 800ms auto-save, attachments (images/videos, 25MB max), Individual/Combined view, drag-to-reorder sidebar, resizable sidebar
- Preferences persisted per user + per system via `UserPreference`:
  - `adminnotes_sidebar_width`
  - `adminnotes_view_mode_<s>`
  - `adminnotes_combined_sort_<s>`

### Storage: `admin-notes` bucket
- Supabase Storage, public
- RLS for authenticated users
- Path: `<userId>/<noteId>/<timestamp>-<rand>-<safeName>`
- Deferred: switch to private + signed URLs

### Bulk API pattern
Routes modifying many records use Prisma `$transaction`:
- `PATCH /api/projects/[id]/keywords` (bulk)
- `PATCH /api/projects/[id]/canvas/nodes` (bulk)
- `POST /api/projects/[id]/canvas/rebuild` (atomic)
- `POST /api/admin-notes/reorder`

### Workflow Status Tracking (live as of Ckpt 5)
- Helper: `src/lib/workflow-status.ts` → `markWorkflowActive(projectId, workflow)` and `ensureProjectWorkflow(projectId, workflow)`
- `markWorkflowActive` is called after every mutation in KC workflow-data routes
- Logic: if status is "inactive", bump to "active" + set `firstActivityAt`. If "completed", leave status alone but still update `lastActivityAt`. Refresh `lastActivityAt` on every call.
- `ensureProjectWorkflow` is used by status-read endpoints to avoid 404s on never-visited workspaces — creates Inactive row silently if needed.

## 8. Keyword Clustering — tool architecture (for reference)

### Top-level component (as of Ckpt 7)
`src/app/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering/page.tsx` (164 lines) — single-state, Project pre-picked from URL via `useParams()`.

### Main workspace
`src/app/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering/components/KeywordWorkspace.tsx` — orchestrates when active

### Components (all under `src/app/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering/components/` post-Ckpt-7)
| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ASTTable, MTTable, TIFTable | Manual mode tables |
| KASTable, TVTTable | AI mode analysis + topics tables |
| CanvasPanel, CanvasTableMode, CanvasEditPanel | Canvas system |
| AutoAnalyze | AI-powered auto-analyze (76KB) |
| KeywordWorkspace | Top-level orchestrator |
| FloatingPanel, ScrollArrows | UI utilities |

### Hooks
- `useKeywords.ts` — keyword state + batchUpdate + reorder
- `useCanvas.ts` — canvas state (lifted to KeywordWorkspace)

### Technical notes
- `xlsx` package: dynamic `await import('xlsx')` only (no top-level)
- `resolveOverlap` must run BEFORE `updateNodes()` save
- `useCanvas` lifted to KeywordWorkspace, passed as prop to CanvasPanel
- `aiMode` lives in page.tsx, passed as prop. **Per-session only — resets on page refresh** (tracked as Phase 1-polish item).
- Canvas multi-select uses refs (avoids stale closures)
- TSV export includes hidden X/Y columns
- Auto-Analyze Direct = browser→Anthropic, Server = browser→Vercel→Anthropic (5min timeout)
- Node layout: title (22px) → alt titles (14px) → description → KW preview (36px) → badge (18px)
- Checkpoint: localStorage `aa_checkpoint_{projectWorkflowId}` (key uses projectWorkflowId, not projectId)
- Sister links API: `POST /api/projects/{id}/canvas/sister-links` (URL unchanged; internals use projectWorkflowId)

## 9. Environment variables

Required in `.env.local` (local) and Vercel (production):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[project].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...      # server-side only — NEVER expose
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...      # pooled
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://...        # direct (for migrations)
```

---

## 10. Known technical debt (deferred)

From Phase 1-foundation:
- Shared Keyword type to `src/types/keyword.ts`
- Unify volume type (Prisma Int vs TS string)
- Mutable state in CanvasPanel drag handlers
- ASTRow memoization
- Error state in useCanvas + error UI + retry
- Optimistic update rollback

From Phase 2:
- Move Think Tank projects from localStorage to DB
- Remove committed `.bak*` files; add `*.bak*` to `.gitignore`
- Switch `admin-notes` bucket to private + signed URLs
- Middleware deprecation warning (Next.js 16 "proxy" convention)
- Rich text editor uses deprecated `document.execCommand`

From Phase M:
- Two uncommitted handoff files live in `src/app/` (`HANDOFF.md`, `ROADMAP.md`) — should be relocated to repo root or `/docs` folder; files in `src/app/` risk Next.js treating them as routes
- `prisma/schema.prisma.bak` and backup branch `phase-m-safety-net` can be removed once Phase M is fully verified deployed
- **NEW from Ckpt 7 (2026-04-17):** ~30 `.bak`/`.bak2`/`.bak3` etc. files live in `src/app/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering/components/` (moved alongside the real components from their old location). Dead weight. Remove in Ckpt 9 cleanup.

From Phase M Ckpt 5 (2026-04-17):
- ✅ **Race condition on `nextNodeId` / `nextPathwayId`** — RESOLVED in Pivot Session E (2026-04-25). Switched to UUID PKs for `CanvasNode.id` and `Pathway.id`; the surviving per-project `nextStableIdN` counter is incremented atomically inside a `$transaction` in `/canvas/nodes` POST.
- Asymmetric `canvasState` upsert logic between `canvas/nodes/route.ts` POST and `canvas/pathways/route.ts` POST — worth normalizing.
- `ops as any` TypeScript workaround in `canvas/rebuild/route.ts` — pre-existing, low priority.

From Platform Architectural Reveal chat (2026-04-17 — chat `cc15409c-...`):
- 🆕 **`/projects` page design is incomplete for Phase 3 scale.** Currently sketched for small-scale admin-solo; at 500–5,000 Projects/week and 50 concurrent users, page needs filter/search/sort/pagination/role-scoped queries. Admin-solo version built in Phase M Ckpt 6; scale-aware version planned for Phase 2.
- 🆕 **No assignment table yet.** Phase 2 requires three-way (User, Workflow, Project) assignment model (`PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md §2.2`). Schema not designed.
- 🆕 **No review-cycle infrastructure yet.** Phase 2 requires states (`assigned | in-progress | submitted-for-review | acceptable | revision-requested`) + `ReviewNote` table + email notifications (`PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md §4`). Schema not designed.
- 🆕 **No audit-trail infrastructure yet.** Phase 2 requires `AuditEvent` table + shared emission helper; opt-in per workflow (`PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md §5`). Schema not designed.
- 🆕 **No role column on User records.** Phase 2 requires at minimum `admin | worker` roles with permission middleware on all API routes.
- 🆕 **No real-time collaboration infrastructure.** Phase 2 requires per-workflow strategy (Keyword Clustering: OT/CRDT for 10–20 concurrent editors; others TBD — `PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md §3`). Likely library choice: Supabase Realtime + Yjs, Liveblocks, or similar.
- 🆕 **No Shared Workflow-Tool Scaffold yet.** Required before workflow #2 build begins (`PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md §12`). Design chat not yet scheduled.
- 🆕 **No workflow-readiness resolver yet.** Per-workflow declarative rules will be added as workflows are built; UI indicators (`ready` / `not-ready`) not yet implemented.
- 🆕 **No "reset workflow data" feature in any workflow yet.** Required for admin per `PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md §7`; first implementation will be Keyword Clustering (low priority during Phase 1 solo; high priority before Phase 2 workers arrive).
- 🆕 **Workflow deliverable storage strategy not designed.** Platform will need a deliverables bucket (separate from `admin-notes`) with per-workflow organization, possibly private + signed URLs.

From Phase M Ckpt 6 (2026-04-17):
- 🆕 **Card-label edits (`/dashboard` 3 system cards + `/plos` 14 workflow cards) still save to localStorage.** In Phase 2 these become shared data — admin's edits need to be visible to all workers on all their browsers. Migration to DB required before Phase 2. ROADMAP item logged.

From Phase M Ckpt 7 (2026-04-17):
- 🆕 **Manual/AI toggle on Keyword Clustering page resets on refresh.** Low priority; admin typically uses one mode per session. Would benefit from persisting per-user preference via `UserPreference`. ROADMAP Phase 1-polish item logged.

From Phase M Ckpt 9 (2026-04-17) — **Phase M closeout cleanup completed:**

All pre-Ckpt-9 leftovers handled in commit `3a2b928` (Ckpt 9):
- ✅ 11 untracked `.bak` files (from Ckpts 1-5) deleted from disk
- ✅ 40 committed `.bak` files (from Ckpts 2-8 folder moves and edits) deleted via `git rm` — remain in git history if needed, gone from future commits
- ✅ 2 legacy docs (`src/app/HANDOFF.md`, `src/app/ROADMAP.md`) deleted — they were stale Phase-2-era copies, never authoritative
- ✅ `*.bak*` pattern added to `.gitignore` — future `.bak` files won't accumulate
- ✅ `/docs/` created at repo root with 13 Group A handoff docs + `KEYWORD_CLUSTERING_ACTIVE.md` + `CLAUDE_CODE_STARTER.md` (15 total). Canonical location going forward; Claude Code reads directly from here.

From Phase M Ckpt 9.5 (2026-04-17) — **post-deploy bug fixes:**

- ✅ Admin Notes API (`src/app/api/admin-notes/route.ts`) allowlist extended to include `'dashboard'` and `'plos'` — Ckpt 8's `SystemKey` type extension was incomplete; server-side string validation missed the new systems
- ✅ Business Operations added as 15th entry in `WORKFLOW_DEFS` in `src/app/projects/page.tsx` — Ckpt 6 omitted it from the expanded-accordion render list
- ✅ `src/app/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx` — **built for the first time** (487 lines). Ckpts 6-8 docs all claimed it was built; in reality the file never existed on disk. Discovered during Ckpt 9 visual verification post-deploy. Pattern 7 recurrence documented in CORRECTIONS_LOG.

**Deploy status:** Phase M is fully deployed on vklf.com as of commits `3a2b928` + `fcf2373`. Full Phase 1 happy-path verified working end-to-end.

From Workflow #1 / Auto-Analyze (2026-04-27 V3 small-batch test; design captured 2026-04-27 Scale Session A):
- 🚨 **Canvas Serialization INPUT Context-Scaling — Architectural Concern (DESIGN CAPTURED, BUILD ACTIVATED 2026-04-28).** V3's operations-based output contract (Pivot Sessions A-E, 2026-04-25) solved THREE of four scaling concerns (keyword preservation, output-token scaling, wall-clock per batch) but did NOT solve the fourth — INPUT scaling. **Resolution status as of 2026-04-28:** Scale Session 0 empirical validation ran. Outcome C fired (V3 on Sonnet 4.6 hit 200k context wall at batch 151 of full-Bursitis run; input 220,091 tokens) AND Opus 4.7 cost test confirmed model-upgrade-only is economically prohibitive. Threshold (b) also fired (Bursitis run reached ~700 topics, beyond the 600-topic threshold). **Build path now active:** `INPUT_CONTEXT_SCALING_DESIGN.md` Scale Sessions B–E are the build spec; Scale Session B (schema migration + applier extension + intentFingerprint backfill) is the next-priority forward action for Workflow #1. Empirical run data (2026-04-28 full Bursitis on Sonnet 4.6, 151 of 281 batches): per-batch cost grew $0.20 → $0.85 driven entirely by canvas TSV growing in input; total run cost ~$70-80; ~$130-150 projected if run had completed. Code reality: `src/lib/auto-analyze-v3.ts` line 98 `buildOperationsInputTsv` takes the FULL canvas every batch — verified 2026-04-27 + reconfirmed empirically 2026-04-28. Cross-references: `INPUT_CONTEXT_SCALING_DESIGN.md` (primary) + `ROADMAP.md` 🚨 section + `PIVOT_DESIGN.md §5` + `KEYWORD_CLUSTERING_ACTIVE.md` POST-2026-04-28-SCALE-SESSION-0-OUTCOME-C STATE block.

- ✅ **Canvas-Blanking Intermittent Bug (FIXED 2026-04-29 bug-fix session; HIGH severity; 3 layers of defense shipped).** Originally observed twice in 2026-04-28 full-Bursitis V3 run (batches 70 + 134). Root cause was `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` line 75 silently zeroing nodes on non-array response (e.g., a 5xx error JSON). Fixed via: (1) new pure helper `parseCanvasFetchResponses` in `src/lib/canvas-fetch-parser.ts` (16 unit tests) that classifies the two canvas fetches and returns structured ok/error result; `useCanvas.fetchCanvas` rewritten to preserve prior client state on failure and throw so callers can pause; (2) uniform throw-on-failure contract across all five `useCanvas` methods replacing the previous silent-swallow pattern; (3) new `lastSeenNodesCountRef` + per-batch fail-fast pre-flight at top of `runLoop` while-loop pauses immediately on a non-zero → zero canvas transition between batches; (4) existing runLoop outer try/catch already routes thrown errors to `API_ERROR` state — Layer 1's throw contract now actually propagates through `await onRefreshCanvas()` → `doApplyV3` → runLoop catch. **Live data:** Bursitis canvas wiped wholesale at end-of-session per director's data-deprioritization directive — 690 CanvasNode + 241 SisterLink + 4 Pathway rows deleted; 2,256 keywords reset to Unsorted; canvas state reset to nextStableIdN=1; 73 archived RemovedKeyword rows preserved; one Prisma transaction. Director's Rule 8 explicit YES received with full pre-write count disclosure. **Original ROOT-CAUSE DIAGNOSIS detail is preserved in `ROADMAP.md` under the FIXED entry.** **Vestigial original entry text below preserved for forensic reference:**

- 🚨 **Canvas-Blanking Intermittent Bug — original capture (preserved as historical context; superseded by FIXED entry above).** Empirically observed twice in the 2026-04-28 full-Bursitis V3 run on Sonnet 4.6 (batches 70 and 134 of 151 batches). **Root cause: `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` line 75 — `setNodes(Array.isArray(nodesData) ? nodesData : [])`. When `/api/projects/[id]/canvas/nodes` GET returns a 5xx error (response body `{ error: 'Failed to fetch nodes' }`, status 500), the response is non-array → `setNodes([])` fires silently. Two design defects combine: (a) `response.ok` is never checked; (b) the "not an array" fallback is `[]` instead of `prev`.** Most-likely 5xx trigger: connection-pool flake on the Supabase pgbouncer pooler under sustained run load (~2,500-3,800 transactions in ~3 hours of a 151-batch run). **Cascade:** 168 keywords across the 2 events silently abandoned for the rest of the run because batch queue is fixed at run-start. **Forensic confirmation:** live DB has 17 orphan-root + descendant nodes from the two events (`t-285`..`t-291`, `t-594`..`t-604`), all with identical createdAt timestamps within a single transaction; titles match the V3 prompt's example funnel-stage roots almost verbatim, confirming the model was correctly building from an empty canvas. **Fix design (locked):** defensive `useCanvas.fetchCanvas` (check `response.ok`, preserve previous state on failure, throw on parse failure) + fail-fast pre-flight in `runLoop` + post-fix cleanup of the 17 orphan nodes. ~1-2 hours code + small unit test. Push gated by Rule 9. Cross-references: `ROADMAP.md` "Canvas-Blanking Intermittent Bug" section (full root-cause + cascade table) + `KEYWORD_CLUSTERING_ACTIVE.md` POST-2026-04-28-DEEPER-ANALYSIS STATE block. RELATED to but DISTINCT from P3-F7 silent-placements + ghost-AI-Sorted bugs (P3-F7 was about status-flip drift in `doApply`; this is about the wiring layer not sending canvas state to the model in the first place).

- 🚀 **Scale Session B SHIPPED 2026-04-30 — `intentFingerprint` foundation for Tiered Canvas Serialization.** Per `INPUT_CONTEXT_SCALING_DESIGN.md` §6 Scale Session B. **Schema change:** `CanvasNode.intentFingerprint String` added via 3-step migration (Step 1 nullable; Step 2 AI backfill of 37 live Bursitis Test rows via new `scripts/backfill-intent-fingerprints.ts` ≈ $0.20 across dry-run + real; Step 3 NOT NULL). Cross-step ordering: Step 1 + code paths deployed (commit `350e7dc`) BEFORE Step 3 to avoid breaking production INSERTs that don't supply the new column. Information_schema confirms post-Step-3 `is_nullable: "NO"`. **Code paths shipped:** (1) Operation applier (`src/lib/operation-applier.ts`) — `CanvasNode` model gains required `intentFingerprint: string`; `AddTopicOp` / `UpdateTopicTitleOp` / `UpdateTopicDescriptionOp` / `MergeTopicsOp.mergedIntentFingerprint` / `SplitTopicOp.into[].intentFingerprint` gain optional fields with `validateOptionalFingerprint` rejecting empty/whitespace when supplied (soft-validation in Session B; tightens to required in Session D after V4 prompts ship). (2) Parser (`src/lib/auto-analyze-v3.ts`) translates snake_case → camelCase across all 5 op types incl. `merged_intent_fingerprint`. `CanvasNodeRow.intentFingerprint?: string | null` accepts pre-Step-3 + post-Step-3 DB shapes. Rebuild-payload constructor omits empty fingerprint to prevent G3 false-positive on transient empty values mid-batch. (3) Routes — POST `/canvas/nodes` and rebuild upsert.create both supply `intentFingerprint: ''` placeholder. (4) **G3 server-side guard** (per Defense-in-Depth §5.4) shipped on `/canvas/nodes` PATCH + rebuild route — rejects empty/whitespace fingerprints with 400 before any DB write. **R3** (Tier-1 fingerprint runtime invariant) still pending — lives in the future serializer (Scale Session C). 22 new src/lib unit tests (16 applier fingerprint + 6 parser fingerprint) → 210 passing total. Build clean; lint at exact baseline parity (zero new). Two pushes deployed; vklf.com visually verified. Rule-16 zoom-out clean: only 2 `canvasNode.create`/`upsert.create` callers exist in src/, both patched. Backfill script idempotent: predicate `intentFingerprint = ''` (post-Step-3, NOT NULL means '' is the only "needs backfill" state). Multi-workflow protocol: schema-change-in-flight flag flipped Yes→No around the migration; W#2 unaffected.

- 🚨 **Connection pool exhaustion under apply-pipeline burst (DISCOVERED 2026-05-04-c — live D3 retry attempt; fires ON PRO TIER per post-original-commit correction; POOL-TUNE TRIED 2026-05-04-d INSUFFICIENT; burst-size corrected 2026-05-04-d from 22 → 55-60+).** **2026-05-04-d update:** director executed three-step pool investigation tonight (Pro confirmed; compute revealed as Nano; pool 15 → 40 = 67% of Nano's 60-cap max_connections); small-batch test on Bursitis Test 2 batch 2 produced same FATAL: Max client connections reached. Vercel log expansion revealed actual burst is **55-60+ parallel PATCH calls per batch** (~40 successful + ~18 failed in a 3-second window) — not the 22 estimated 2026-05-04-c. Pool tune at Nano compute is structurally insufficient (any safe pool size ≤ 48 leaves ~10+ failures). Pool 40 stays in place as secondary buffer. **Code-fix path (parallel-PATCH-burst reduction) is now PRIMARY and gate-blocking** — three approaches (worker queue / bulk PATCH endpoint / atomic-batch-into-rebuild-transaction); approach (iii) atomic-batch eliminates the P2025 race condition for free + scales structurally for Phase 3. **P2025 race condition discovered same session** as separate MEDIUM finding (canvas-rebuild $transaction archives keyword while parallel PATCH still in-flight against it). Tightened Phase 3 math: 50 workers × 60 burst = 3000 simultaneous connections — uncoverable by any compute upgrade Supabase offers. Discovered live during the D3 retry attempt 2026-05-04-c. After batch 1's model-side + server-side apply succeeded cleanly ($0.312, 15 ops, canvas at 124 nodes), the post-rebuild UI refresh hit ~28 cascading HTTP 500s within ~0.1 seconds at 8:30:40 PM (~22 PATCH /keywords/[id] failures + 6 GET /canvas + /canvas/nodes failures), ALL with the same root error: `FATAL: Max client connections reached`. The Supabase connection pool through the pgbouncer transaction pooler at port 6543 was overwhelmed by the apply-pipeline's parallel keyword-update burst. **CORRECTION post-original-commit:** the original entry framed this as "Free-tier capacity ran out; Pro upgrade fixes it." Director clarified at end-of-session that Pro upgrade was already in place at end of 2026-05-04-b — tonight's failure fired ON Pro tier. More serious structural finding than the original framing suggested. **This is a CAPACITY problem, not a transient-flake problem** — it surfaces as `PrismaClientUnknownRequestError` / `PrismaClientInitializationError` with no Prisma error code, just the FATAL message embedded in `error.message`. **The 2026-05-04-b withRetry rate-fix structurally cannot help** — `withRetry` retries transient codes P1001/P1002/P1008/P2034; pool exhaustion has no code. Retries actively make it worse (each retry adds connection pressure). **Three layers of fix needed (REVISED post-correction):** (a) ✅ **Supabase Pro upgrade — DONE 2026-05-04-b** (necessary but not sufficient; tonight's failure proves Pro alone doesn't clear the wall under the burst pattern), (a-prime) **Tune Pro tier's pool size config knob (PROBABLE PRIMARY FIX — NEW)** — Pro exposes a configurable pool-size knob; default may still be too small for our ~22-parallel-PATCH burst; ~5-10 min Supabase dashboard change to increase from default to e.g., 30-50, (b) **apply-pipeline parallel-PATCH-burst reduction (PROMOTED FROM DEFERRED-COMPANION TO PRIMARY CODE-SIDE PATH if (a-prime) doesn't clear the wall)** — investigate serializing the ~22 parallel PATCH /keywords/[id] calls per batch via small worker queue OR using existing bulk PATCH /keywords endpoint OR atomically batching into the canvas rebuild transaction (heavier refactor), (c) **add pool-config visibility to pre-flight runner** — surface active Supabase plan tier + configured pool size at run start with warning if pool looks too small for expected burst. **Phase 3 implication (zoom-out per Rule 16):** at 50 concurrent workers (Phase 3 scale target per `PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md §1`), pool exhaustion will be vastly worse than today's solo-director load. Pro upgrade is necessary but not sufficient — the apply-pipeline parallel-burst pattern itself needs revisiting before Phase 3, OR the connection pool needs tuning beyond Pro's defaults. Architectural concern that propagates to W#2-W#14 because they share the same DB + pool.

Cold-start GETs `/keywords` GET + `/removed-keywords` GET deliberately left server-unwrapped because already defended at client layer by 2026-05-03 cold-start retry helper. **Why this lives in PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE not just KEYWORD_CLUSTERING_ACTIVE:** the wrapped helpers in `lib/auth.ts` + `lib/workflow-status.ts` are platform-shared — every authenticated API route in every future workflow benefits from the helper-level wrap automatically. Cross-references: `ROADMAP.md` "🟡 FIRST RATE-FIX SHIPPED 2026-05-04-b — Underlying ~25% per-endpoint pgbouncer/Prisma flake rate" entry. `KEYWORD_CLUSTERING_ACTIVE.md` POST-2026-05-04-B-RATE-FIX-FIRST-PASS STATE block. `src/lib/prisma-retry.ts` (the existing G2 helper).

- 📊 **Platform-wide flake-rate telemetry (SHIPPED 2026-05-04 — first investigation session of the underlying ~25% pgbouncer/Prisma flake-rate fix; W#1 PRODUCTION-READINESS GATE prerequisite #3).** New pure helper `src/lib/flake-counter.ts` (~140 LOC) exporting `recordFlake(endpoint, error, ctx?)` — emits a single grep-able `[FLAKE]` line via `console.error` with stable shape `[FLAKE] endpoint=<METHOD /path> code=<P1001|...|unknown> retried=<true|false> [canvasSize=<N>] [projectWorkflowId=<id>] msg="<200-char-truncated>"`. All 19 DB-backed API routes wired with `recordFlake(...)` calls in their catch blocks (38 catch blocks ↔ 38 call sites — exact 1-to-1; additive only — runs BEFORE the existing `console.error` so the pre-existing diagnostic dump is preserved). Two routes already wrapped in withRetry (`GET /canvas` + `GET /canvas/nodes`) record with `retried: true` so analysis can separate "wrapped-and-still-failed" from "raw flake". `/canvas/rebuild` POST captures `body.nodes.length` payload size as `canvasSize` to test the "transaction-duration scales with payload → pgbouncer pressure" hypothesis. 28 unit tests in `src/lib/flake-counter.test.ts`. The 20th route file (`/api/ai/analyze/route.ts`) doesn't use Prisma — deliberately skipped. **Investigation findings 2026-05-04 (preserved here as platform-level facts, not just W#1):** (a) Supabase confirmed using transaction pooler at port 6543 with `?pgbouncer=true` (DATABASE_URL); migrations use direct port 5432 (DIRECT_URL); pgbouncer hypothesis correctly grounded — every runtime DB call goes through the pooler. (b) **withRetry parity is ~4%** at the endpoint layer — only `/canvas` GET + `/canvas/nodes` GET have G2 coverage; everything else (apply-pipeline writes, cold-start fetches, page-render, admin-notes, user-prefs) is unwrapped. (c) **Hidden silent multiplier:** auth + activity-tracking helpers in `lib/auth.ts` (verifyProjectAuth + verifyProjectWorkflowAuth) and `lib/workflow-status.ts` (markWorkflowActive + ensureProjectWorkflow) make Prisma calls on EVERY authenticated request and are themselves unwrapped — a flake here surfaces as a 500 even on the 2 routes that DO have withRetry. (d) Prisma client at `src/lib/db.ts` uses bare singleton with no `$connect`/`$disconnect` lifecycle; no `@prisma/adapter-pg`. **Why this lives in PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE not just KEYWORD_CLUSTERING_ACTIVE:** the helper is workflow-agnostic; every future DB-backed route across all 14 PLOS workflows should use the same telemetry surface. Adding a new endpoint = one `import` + one `recordFlake(...)` call per catch block.

- 🛡️ **Defense-in-Depth Audit Implementation Session 1 (SHIPPED 2026-04-29-b; Option β Session 1 of 2).** Per `DEFENSE_IN_DEPTH_AUDIT_DESIGN.md` §7 — locks in codebase-wide structural defenses on top of the per-fix work shipped earlier 2026-04-29. **What's now permanent:** (1) **ESLint rule `no-prop-reads-in-runloop`** at `eslint-rules/no-prop-reads-in-runloop.js` (~165 lines) wired into `eslint.config.mjs` as a local plugin via `defineConfig`; codifies the `AutoAnalyze.tsx:163` invariant as a build-time gate — any direct read of `nodes`/`allKeywords`/`sisterLinks`/`pathways` inside a function annotated `@runloop-reachable` fails `npm run build`. Bootstrap annotations on `runLoop`, `doApplyV3`, `processBatchV3`, `validateResultV3`. 13 unit tests + integration smoke verified. (2) **Runtime invariant R2** in `handleReconcileNow`: re-runs `computeReconciliationUpdates` against the in-memory post-PATCH keyword set and logs WARN if non-empty — soft signal that something stopped the updates from landing. (3) **Server-side guard G1** at `src/lib/canvas-rebuild-guard.ts` exposing `evaluateRebuildPayload` + `G1_SHRINK_THRESHOLD = 0.5`; `/canvas/rebuild` POST returns HTTP 400 if `body.nodes` provided AND `deleteNodeIds` empty AND new-node count would shrink canvas by >50%. The 2026-04-28 events were 95% and 98% drops; legitimate batch ops modify <5%. 13 unit tests covering matrix cells. (4) **Server-side guard G2** at `src/lib/prisma-retry.ts` exposing `withRetry(fn, options)` + `isTransientPrismaError(e)`; `/canvas/nodes` GET wraps `prisma.canvasNode.findMany` so transient connection-pool flakes (P1001/P1002/P1008/P2034) retry 100ms then 500ms before surfacing as 500. 17 unit tests including timing verification. **R3 + G3** explicitly deferred to Scale Session B (depend on `intentFingerprint` schema column). **R4** deferred per design §3.2.4 + director Q2=B. **Implementation Session 2** (forensic NDJSON log + run-start pre-flight P1-P10) still pending — independent of any other work, ~3-4 hrs.

- ✅ **Reconciliation-Pass Closure-Staleness Bug (FIXED 2026-04-29 bug-fix session; HIGH severity; 3 layers of defense shipped).** Originally a regression of the documented 2026-04-18 stale-closure pattern, manifesting at `AutoAnalyze.tsx:830` as `for (const kw of allKeywords)` reading the closure-frozen prop instead of `keywordsRef.current`. Fixed via: (1) reconciliation logic extracted to pure helper `computeReconciliationUpdates(keywords, placedSet, archivedSet)` in `src/lib/reconciliation.ts` (10 unit tests including the 84-keyword 2026-04-28 stale-vs-fresh contrast scenario) — pure function with no closure to capture from; (2) at `doApplyV3` function entry, `allKeywords` and `pathways` are SHADOWED by locals pointing at `keywordsRef.current` / `pathwaysRef.current` so closure-frozen props are physically unreachable for every read inside the function (lines 707 + 858 reads automatically resolve to fresh state); new `pathwaysRef` added to match the existing nodes/keywords/sisterLinks ref pattern; (3) line-153 invariant comment rewritten from passive "must read via refs" to a positive description of the shadow strategy as the new convention. **Live data:** the 84 stuck-Reshuffled keywords + 232 status-drift residuals were eliminated by the wholesale Bursitis canvas wipe at end-of-session. Reconcile Now admin button shipped as forward-looking forensic + healing tool for any future drift. **Vestigial original entry text below preserved for forensic reference:**

- 🚨 **Reconciliation-Pass Closure-Staleness Bug — original capture (preserved as historical context; superseded by FIXED entry above).** Pattern recurrence of the documented closure-staleness bug from `CORRECTIONS_LOG.md` 2026-04-18 (Bug A: `buildCurrentTsv` reading props instead of refs) + 2026-04-19 (fix validated). The 2026-04-18 fix added a code-comment invariant at `AutoAnalyze.tsx:153`: *"runLoop-reachable code must read nodes/allKeywords/sisterLinks via *Ref.current, not raw props — the async runLoop closure freezes props. See CORRECTIONS_LOG 2026-04-18."* The original `buildCurrentTsv` was deleted in Pivot Session E (2026-04-25). The reconciliation pass added later in Session 3b wrote new code at `AutoAnalyze.tsx:822-848` that mostly honors the invariant (line 656 in the same function uses `keywordsRef.current` correctly), but **line 830's `for (const kw of allKeywords)` violates it** — reading the closure-frozen prop instead of the ref. **Symptom:** every reconciliation pass in every run since Session 3b shipped (2026-04-25) has been reading stale `allKeywords`. The healing branch (`onCanvas + Reshuffled → AI-Sorted`) never fires for keywords whose status was flipped earlier in the same run; the punishment branch (`!onCanvas + AI-Sorted → Reshuffled`) can fire on a misleadingly-stale view. **Live DB confirmation:** exactly 84 keywords stuck `Reshuffled` (matches predicted count from the math), all 84 still ON the canvas; 232 status drift residuals (147 ghost AI-Sorted + 85 silent placements) partly attributable to this bug. **Fix design (locked):** one-token change — `for (const kw of allKeywords)` → `for (const kw of keywordsRef.current)` at `AutoAnalyze.tsx:830`. ~5 min code + ~15 min test. Post-fix cleanup of live data: "Reconcile Now" admin button or one-off SQL/Prisma script. Push gated by Rule 9. Cross-references: `ROADMAP.md` "Reconciliation-Pass Closure-Staleness Bug" section + `CORRECTIONS_LOG.md` 2026-04-18 + 2026-04-19 entries + `AutoAnalyze.tsx:153` invariant comment + `PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md` line 407 (platform-level recognition of refs-vs-stale-closure pattern). Compounds the canvas-blanking bug above (both motivated the new "🛡️ Redundancy + Defense-in-Depth Audit" item in ROADMAP) but is INDEPENDENT — fixing one does not fix the other.

## 11. Performance considerations

### Current
- Bulk endpoints use `$transaction`
- Canvas visibility-aware rendering
- AST 200ms search debounce
- Virtual scroll for keyword lists

### Planned (Phase 1-realtime)
- Server-side cursor pagination for keywords
- Server-side search/filtering/sorting
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions

---

## 12. Deployment

### Flow
```
Codespace edit → git commit → git push origin main → Vercel auto-deploy → live at vklf.com
```

### Before every push
- `npm run build` must succeed locally
- Migration involved? Verify in Prisma Studio first
- `cp file file.bak` any replaced file
- `wc -l` to verify line count

### After every deploy
- Test at https://vklf.com with Ctrl+Shift+R
- Ask user to visually confirm

### Phase M deployment note
**Phase M is FULLY DEPLOYED as of 2026-04-17.** The DB schema, server-side API routes, client-side pages, and cleanup are all live on vklf.com. Final commits: `3a2b928` (Ckpt 9 — deploy + docs/ setup + cleanup) and `fcf2373` (Ckpt 9.5 — post-deploy bug fixes). Full Phase 1 happy-path verified working end-to-end. Safety branch `phase-m-safety-net` at `f545e2a` preserved (deletable at user's discretion — no longer needed).

## 13. Phase 2 schema sketch (planned, NOT YET BUILT)

This section records the schema additions that Phase 2 will require. These tables do NOT exist in the database as of April 17, 2026. This sketch is a **planning reference**, not a commitment to specific field names — final shape will be decided at Phase 2 design time.

### 13.1 Assignment (three-way join)

```prisma
model Assignment {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId      String
  projectId   String
  workflow    String   // e.g., "keyword-clustering"
  grantedBy   String   // admin userId
  grantedAt   DateTime @default(now())
  revokedAt   DateTime?
  reviewState String   @default("assigned") // "assigned"|"in-progress"|"submitted-for-review"|"acceptable"|"revision-requested"

  project     Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([userId, projectId, workflow])
  @@index([userId])
  @@index([projectId, workflow])
  @@index([reviewState])
}
```

Notes:
- Review state lives on the Assignment (per-user) not on ProjectWorkflow (per-project), because multiple users can have different review states on the same (project, workflow) simultaneously.
- `revokedAt` allows admin to revoke access without deleting history.
- Index on `reviewState` supports admin queries like "show me all assignments awaiting review."

### 13.2 ReviewNote

```prisma
model ReviewNote {
  id            String     @id @default(uuid())
  assignmentId  String
  authorUserId  String     // usually admin
  content       String     @db.Text  // rich text
  createdAt     DateTime   @default(now())

  assignment    Assignment @relation(fields: [assignmentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([assignmentId])
}
```

Notes:
- One assignment can have many review notes (revision → resubmit → revision cycles).
- Content supports rich text (reuse Admin Notes editor component).

### 13.3 AuditEvent

```prisma
model AuditEvent {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  projectId   String
  workflow    String
  userId      String
  eventType   String   // workflow-specific, e.g., "keyword.created", "node.moved"
  payload     Json     @default("{}")
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())

  @@index([projectId, workflow])
  @@index([userId, createdAt])
  @@index([createdAt])
}
```

Notes:
- Opt-in per workflow (not every workflow emits audit events).
- No FK to Project — intentionally soft — so that audit history survives Project deletion if needed (policy TBD).
- Payload is JSON for workflow-specific event data.
- At Phase 4 scale (5,000 Projects/week), this table may need partitioning or archival.

### 13.4 User role

The existing user record (managed by Supabase Auth) will need a role attribute in Phase 2. Two likely options:
- **Option A:** Add a `UserRole` table with `(userId, role)` rows, allowing multi-role users
- **Option B:** Add a `role` column to a `UserProfile` table (new) since Supabase's `auth.users` isn't directly extensible

Decision deferred to Phase 2 planning.

### 13.5 Workflow deliverable storage

At Phase 2, workflows produce files (images, PDFs, videos, design files, compliance docs). Current `admin-notes` bucket is not appropriate (wrong scope, public, wrong security posture).

Likely design (to be confirmed at Phase 2):
- New bucket `workflow-deliverables` (private, signed URLs)
- Path pattern: `<projectId>/<workflow>/<filename>`
- `Deliverable` table recording metadata (owner, uploaded-by, versioned, etc.)
