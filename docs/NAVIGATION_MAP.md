# NAVIGATION MAP
## Every route, every click path through PLOS — the single source of truth for UI navigation

**Last updated:** May 6, 2026 (W#2 PLOS-side build first slice — added W#2 Competition Scraping & Deep Analysis route at `/projects/[projectId]/competition-scraping` composing 7 components from the Shared Workflow Components Library.)
**Last updated in session:** session_2026-05-06_w2-plos-side-build-first-slice (Claude Code, on `workflow-2-competition-scraping` branch)
**Previously updated:** May 5, 2026-c (Shared Workflow Components Library Phase-1 build — added internal smoke-test route at `/components-smoke-test` for visual verification of all 9 Phase-1 components.)
**Previously updated in session:** session_2026-05-05-c_components-library-phase-1-build (Claude Code)
**Previously updated:** April 17, 2026 (Phase M COMPLETE — Ckpts 9 + 9.5 deployed to vklf.com; `/projects/[projectId]` detail page live for first time)
**Last updated in chat:** https://claude.ai/chat/75cc8985-b70a-49f4-8b64-444c34ef541f
**Chat where originally created:** https://claude.ai/chat/8320490b-3910-4b3d-b3f8-8222e25777c2

**Purpose:** This document is the authoritative map of how users navigate through the platform. If any navigation flow is not documented here, Claude must ASK the user before writing instructions that involve it.

**Rule for Claude:** Never invent a navigation flow. If the map does not cover a path, the path does not exist (for the purposes of your instructions) until you verify it with the user or the code.

## Status note (post-Phase-M)

**Phase M is COMPLETE as of 2026-04-17.** All routes below are live on vklf.com. The DB schema, server-side API, and UI pages are all aligned and verified working end-to-end.

- **Database schema + server-side API routes:** ✅ LIVE (Ckpt 5)
- **`/projects` page:** ✅ LIVE — list page with search, filter, sort, infinite scroll, new/edit/delete (Ckpt 6)
- **`/projects/[projectId]` detail page:** ✅ LIVE — Project header + 15-card workflow grid with status badges + coming-soon toast for non-active workflows (Ckpt 9.5 — note: Ckpt 6 docs claimed this was built then but the file didn't exist; built for real in Ckpt 9.5. See CORRECTIONS_LOG for the Pattern 7 recurrence.)
- **`/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering`:** ✅ LIVE (Ckpt 7) — single-state Keyword Clustering workspace, Project pre-selected from URL
- **`/keyword-clustering`:** ✅ DELETED (Ckpt 7) — folder removed entirely; route no longer exists
- **`/plos` Keyword Analysis card:** ✅ LIVE (Ckpt 8) — routes to `/projects` list
- **`/dashboard/notes` + `/plos/notes`:** ✅ LIVE (Ckpt 8; note-creation fixed in Ckpt 9.5 — API allowlist had to be extended)
- **`/docs/`:** ✅ CREATED (Ckpt 9) — canonical handoff doc location at repo root

**Deploy hold lifted.** All Phase M commits pushed and serving on vklf.com. Commits in stack: `fcf2373` (Ckpt 9.5) → `3a2b928` (Ckpt 9) → `ac62a3a` (Ckpt 8) → `5cc10c5` (Ckpt 7) → `3b69cf2` (Ckpt 6) → `14d68e7` (Ckpt 5) → `f545e2a` (pre-Phase-M safety branch anchor).

**Auth required:** Yes

**Which cards are Active (currently only one — and its route is now correct as of Ckpt 8):**
| Card | Status | Click → |
|---|---|---|
| 🔑 Keyword Analysis & Intent Discovery | **Active** | `/projects` (✅ rewired in Ckpt 8 — pick a Project, then enter its Keyword Analysis workflow) |

**What the user sees:**
- Top bar: "← Back to Projects" (returns to `/projects`) + "Sign Out"
- Project header: Project name (26px), description (wraps at 720px max-width), "Last activity: ..." caption
- "Workflows" section label (small uppercase)
- Grid of 14 workflow cards (auto-fill minmax 260px — larger and roomier than the in-accordion grid on `/projects`). Each card shows:

| Action | Destination |
|---|---|
| Click Back to Projects | `/projects` |
| Click Keyword Analysis card | `/projects/[id]/keyword-clustering` ✅ |
| Click any other workflow card | "coming soon" toast |

### `/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering` — Keyword Clustering workspace (✅ BUILT in Ckpt 7)

**What the user sees:**
- Top bar:
  - Left: "← Back to Project" link (returns to `/projects/[projectId]`) + vertical separator + "🔑 Keyword Clustering · v1.0" title + vertical separator + Project name (fetched from the API)
  - Right: Manual/AI mode toggle (blue=selected)
- Loading state: "Loading Project…" while the Project's name is being fetched
- Error state (if Project doesn't exist or user doesn't have access): ⚠️ icon + friendly message + "← Back to Projects" button
- Main content area: the full `<KeywordWorkspace>` component, which is the actual tool (same code as before Ckpt 7 — unchanged)
  - **Manual mode:** 3-panel left (AST + MT + TIF tables) + Topics Layout Canvas on the right
  - **AI mode:** Single Keywords Working Area (one of 4 views — Normal/Common/Analysis/Topics) + Canvas + Auto-Analyze pane
  - Canvas has two modes: Mindmap (default) and Table

**What's different from the old `/keyword-clustering`:**
- Single-state design — the old "pick a project" screen is GONE (the user arrives here having already picked a Project on the `/projects` page)
- URL contains the Project ID, so browser back/forward works correctly
- Browser back from this page returns to wherever the user came from (typically `/projects/[projectId]`), NOT to `/plos`
- "Back to Project" button explicitly returns to `/projects/[projectId]` (the Project detail page), one level up in the breadcrumb

**Auth required:** Yes (redirects to `/` if no session; shows error state if user doesn't own the Project)

**Transitions out:**
| Action | Destination |
|---|---|
| Click "← Back to Project" | `/projects/[projectId]` |
| Click "← Back to Projects" (only shown on error state) | `/projects` |
| Browser back | Typically `/projects/[projectId]` |
| Toggle Manual/AI | Switches mode (stays on same URL; preference is per-session, resets on page refresh — see ROADMAP Phase 1-polish item) |
| Various tool actions | See `KEYWORD_CLUSTERING_ACTIVE.md` for full details |

**Source file:** `src/app/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering/page.tsx` (164 lines) + `src/app/projects/[projectId]/keyword-clustering/components/KeywordWorkspace.tsx` (workspace orchestrator) + the rest of the `components/` folder

**API endpoint used by page wrapper:** `GET /api/projects/[projectId]` (to fetch Project name for header)

## 4. Navigation gotchas (things that don't work how you'd expect)

### Gotcha 1: ~~`/plos` Keyword Analysis card currently 404s~~ ✅ RESOLVED (Ckpt 8)
Previously, the Keyword Analysis card on `/plos` pointed at the deleted `/keyword-clustering` route. As of Ckpt 8, the card's route was rewired to `/projects`. Clicking the card now correctly navigates to the Projects list, where the user picks a Project and then enters its Keyword Analysis workflow.

### Gotcha 2: Manual/AI toggle resets on page refresh
The Manual/AI mode preference on the Keyword Clustering top bar is per-session. Refreshing the page or navigating away and back resets to Manual. Persisting the preference per-user per-workflow is tracked as a Phase 1-polish item in ROADMAP.

### Gotcha 3: Currently only Keyword Clustering is Active — all other workflows show a toast
Attempting to click any of the other 13 PLOS workflow cards (including Business Operations) shows a "coming soon" toast and stays on `/plos`. The `/projects` page and `/projects/[projectId]` detail page also show the same "coming soon" toast for the 13 coming-soon workflows.

### Gotcha 4: Codespace PORTS tab often doesn't show port 3000
Don't try to access the app via Codespace port forwarding. Push to GitHub → wait for Vercel → test at vklf.com. Currently BLOCKED by Phase M deploy hold until Ckpt 9.

### Gotcha 5: Direct browser access to a Project ID you don't own shows a friendly error
If you navigate directly to `/projects/[some-id-you-don't-own]/keyword-clustering`, the page will show "You do not have access to this Project" with a button to return to `/projects`. Same if the ID doesn't exist: "This Project no longer exists."

### Gotcha 6: Deploy hold — none of Phase M is live on vklf.com yet
All work from Ckpts 1–8 exists only in local commits on the `main` branch (4 commits ahead of origin/main: `14d68e7` Ckpt 5, `3b69cf2` Ckpt 6, `5cc10c5` Ckpt 7, `ac62a3a` Ckpt 8). The live site still runs the pre-Phase-M code (which is fully broken against the new database schema that IS live on Supabase). This is by design; deploy happens in Ckpt 9.

---

## 5. Planned navigation changes (Phase M remaining checkpoint)

### ✅ Ckpt 8: Admin Notes for Dashboard and PLOS + /plos Keyword card rewire — DONE
Completed in chat `fc8025bf-551a-4b3c-8483-ec6d8ed9e33c`:
- ✅ 📝 Notes button added to `/dashboard` top bar → routes to `/dashboard/notes`
- ✅ 📝 Notes button added to `/plos` top bar → routes to `/plos/notes`
- ✅ Both new notes pages use shared `AdminNotes` component (`system="dashboard"` and `system="plos"`)
- ✅ `/plos` Keyword Analysis card rewired from `/keyword-clustering` → `/projects`
- (Workflow-view / Projects-view toggle on `/plos` was considered but deferred — the simple route rewire was chosen as sufficient per user preference; see `CHAT_REGISTRY.md` Ckpt 8 entry)

### Ckpt 9: Deploy + cleanup
- `npm run build` + fix any remaining TypeScript errors
- Handle the `src/app/HANDOFF.md` and `src/app/ROADMAP.md` technical-debt files (move to `/docs` or delete)
- Remove `.bak*` files (13 leftover + ~32 committed — see ROADMAP Ckpt 9 "Pre-Ckpt-9 leftovers inventory") and add pattern to `.gitignore`
- `git push origin main` (4 commits: Ckpt 5, Ckpt 6, Ckpt 7, Ckpt 8)
- Verify at vklf.com with Ctrl+Shift+R

## 6. How to update this document

This is a living document. Whenever a new route is added, a navigation flow changes, or a new gotcha is discovered:

1. Add the route/page under §2
2. Add the click path under §3 if it's a common scenario
3. Add gotchas under §4
4. Update the top-level map (§1) if structure changes

**Who updates:** Claude at end-of-chat, as part of the handoff protocol, whenever navigation changes during the chat.
